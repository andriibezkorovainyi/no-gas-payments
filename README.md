# No Gas Payments

## Overview
The "No Gas Payments" project is a Solidity-based smart contract system designed to facilitate payments on the Ethereum blockchain. It aims to optimize transaction processes by minimizing gas fees and enhancing security.

## Features
- **Smart Contract for Payments**: The [`Payments.sol`](https://github.com/andriibezkorovainyi/no-gas-payments/blob/main/contracts/Payments.sol) contract includes functionalities for secure and efficient payment processing.
- **Nonce Management**: Ensures each transaction is unique to prevent replay attacks.
- **Signature Verification**: Incorporates signature verification to authenticate transactions.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm.
- Familiarity with [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/), a development environment for Ethereum.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/andriibezkorovainyi/no-gas-payments.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Configuration
- Configure your Hardhat environment in [`hardhat.config.ts`](https://github.com/andriibezkorovainyi/no-gas-payments/blob/main/hardhat.config.ts).

## Deployment
- Deploy the smart contract using the script in [`deploy.ts`](https://github.com/andriibezkorovainyi/no-gas-payments/blob/main/scripts/deploy.ts).

## Testing
- Run tests defined in [`Payments.ts`](https://github.com/andriibezkorovainyi/no-gas-payments/blob/main/test/Payments.ts) to ensure the contract functions as expected.
